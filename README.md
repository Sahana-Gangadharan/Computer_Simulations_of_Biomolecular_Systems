# Computer_Simulations_of_Biomolecular_Systems

Assignments, Class Presentation, Examination and Course Project done as a part of BT5420 - Computer Simulations of Biomolecular Systems course offered by Prof Hamsa Priya Mohanasundaram in the Fall (2020) semester.

## Assignment 1

Basics of VMD application was explored to preview protein structures.

## Assignment 2

As an Introduction to GROMACS, this assignment explored neutralization, NVT simulation, NPT simulation and MD simulation.

## Class Presentation 

A 5 minutes presentation of hydrogen bond and dihedral angles.

## Course Project

To produce results from a recent paper that has employed molecular dynamics simulation. Paper I've chosen - 

    De Oliveira CCS, Pereira GRC, De Alcantara JYS, Antunes D, Caffarena ER, De Mesquita JF. In silico analysis of the V66M variant of human BDNF in psychiatric disorders: An approach to precision medicine . PLoS One . 2019;14(4):e0215508.

A point mutation (V66M) is said to have effects on the wildtype behavior of the BDNF protein thus causing psychiatric disorders. The key objective of this paper is to study the molecular dynamics of V66M mutated protein for understanding its effect on psychiatric disorders. 
    
Superimposed structure of the wildtype and the mutated protein are as follows -
